## Scheduling
Lab meetings occur once a week and are coordinated at the start of each term using When2Meet. The meetings are fairly casual and exist for students in the lab to develop skills and community within the lab.

The first lab meeting of term is an opportunity to re-group after break, discuss goals for the term, and assign 5-min papers and headliners.

## Purpose of lab meetings
- Build connection and community in the lab
- Stay up to date on novel research and methods encountered through personal research, classes, etc.
- Provide opportunities to receive feedback from peers on research, presentations, and writing.
- Build and develop skills through mini-workshops, paper discussions, etc.

## Structure of lab meetings
- <ins>**Check-in**</ins> - Rose, Bud, and Thorn. Lab members take turns sharing a highlight of their week (rose),  something they are looking forward to or something they learned (bud), and something that has been challenging / a low point of their week (thorn).
- <ins>**5-minute papers**</ins> - One person a week will present a summary of a paper they have recently read in 5 minutes or less. The point of this exercise is to practice summarizing key information clearly and concisely and to share with the group new research. Opportunities for questions after the 5 min presentation.
- <ins>**Headliner**</ins> - Lab members will alternate each week to lead the lab meeting. Options include presenting your research, leading a paper discussion, or teaching a skill or tool that may be useful to others (tips for leading a successful lab meeting).
