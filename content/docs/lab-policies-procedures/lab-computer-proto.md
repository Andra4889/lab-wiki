## Sharing the Computers
There are fewer computers than students in the lab, so don't hog them! If you are using a remote desktop to log into a computer, check-in with others via the computerchat slack channel to not boot anyone off or interrupt their work. 
When deciding which computer to use, consider what you'll be using it for, what software is available on each, and how much computational power you'll need. Computers 227 and 226 are more powerful than the other computer. 

## Updating the lab computers:
- Rstudio and R
  - how often?
    - how to do this?
  - Other updates?

## Rules of use:
- Use the D: drive for backups and saving work (create your own folder here)
- Q: drive is exclusively for data regarding the field plots in Cambodia and includes plot coordinates, census information, species information, etc.
- If you leave a program running in the background note this for others in the Slack channel or as an open text file so your work is not interrupted or deleted. 
- Sign out of the computer when you're finished using it
- Firewall? Adblockers? personal email accounts?

## Available software and programs:
- ArcGIS Pro
- RStudio
- Lidar360 (only .226)
- What else?

## Computer Access
- Computer log-in:
  - .227 is by the windows
  - .226 is the double screen by the door
  - Username: User
  - Password: In the office, on a blue sticky note, in the top drawer of the plastic drawers in the corner next to Computer .226 
  - D: drive is our primary drive for saving/backups

- Set up for remote desktop:
  - First you need to download cisco any connect:
    - <ins>[UBC IT - cisco anyconnect](https://it.ubc.ca/services/email-voice-internet/myvpn/setup-documents#setup)</ins>
  - And then download Micorosoft Remote Desktop:

  - Log into cisco anyconnect using your CWL 
  - Open Microsoft and select the computer you would like to connect to	
    - IP addresses for the two computers are: 142.103.217.227 and 142.103.217.226
  - Log into the computer using the regular computer log in!
