## Directed and Thesis Studies
A directed study or thesis is a way for undergraduate students to gain research experience. They are available to fourth-year students and are conducted under the guidance of a supervisor. Goals, outcomes, and grading are decided by the student and supervisor at the start of the term. In addition to registering through the SSC, the **course syllabus form must be filled out by the student and supervisor and submitted to your Geography Advisor.** This form can be obtained by contacting the undergraduate student advisor for Geography [(Suzanne Lawrence)](https://geog.ubc.ca/profile/suzanne-lawrence/).
